## Phase 1 Critical Fixes - Ready to Deploy

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06
**Estimated Deployment Time**: 30-45 minutes
**Downtime Required**: None (zero-downtime migrations)

---

## OVERVIEW

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the 5 critical fixes:
1. Row Level Security (RLS) policies
2. Performance indexes
3. Connection pooling fix
4. Error boundaries
5. License calculation fix

---

## PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- [ ] Supabase project access (dashboard or CLI)
- [ ] Database backup completed (production only)
- [ ] Staging environment for testing (recommended)
- [ ] Git repository access
- [ ] Environment variables verified:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

---

## STEP 1: DEPLOY DATABASE MIGRATIONS (15-20 minutes)

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project
   - Click "SQL Editor" in sidebar

2. **Apply RLS Migration**
   - Click "New query"
   - Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/00001_enable_rls.sql`
   - Paste into editor
   - Click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)
   - Wait for "Success" message (~30 seconds)

3. **Apply Indexes Migration**
   - Click "New query"
   - Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/00002_add_indexes.sql`
   - Paste into editor
   - Click "Run"
   - Wait for "Success" message (~2-3 minutes due to CONCURRENTLY)

4. **Verify Migrations**
   ```sql
   -- Check RLS is enabled
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   AND tablename IN ('scenarios', 'organizations', 'personnel_roles',
                     'monthly_opex_projections', 'annual_projections',
                     'funding_rounds', 'assumptions');
   -- All should show rowsecurity = true

   -- Check indexes created
   SELECT tablename, indexname
   FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   ORDER BY tablename;
   -- Should show 26+ new indexes
   ```

### Option B: Supabase CLI (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# 1. Install Supabase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g supabase

# 2. Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# 3. Apply migrations
supabase db push

# 4. Verify migrations
supabase db diff --schema public
# Should show no differences (migrations applied)
```

### Critical Post-Migration Step: Create User-Organization Links

**IMPORTANT**: After enabling RLS, existing users need to be linked to organizations.

```sql
-- Run this in SQL Editor to create initial links:

-- If you have a default organization:
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role)
SELECT
  u.id as user_id,
  o.id as organization_id,
  'owner' as role
FROM auth.users u
CROSS JOIN organizations o
WHERE o.slug = 'default' -- Adjust to your organization identifier
ON CONFLICT (user_id, organization_id) DO NOTHING;

-- If users belong to different organizations:
-- Manually create links based on your data:
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role)
VALUES
  ('user-uuid-1', 'org-uuid-1', 'owner'),
  ('user-uuid-2', 'org-uuid-2', 'owner')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, organization_id) DO NOTHING;
```

**WARNING**: Without user_organizations records, users won't see ANY data due to RLS policies.

---

## STEP 2: DEPLOY APPLICATION CODE (10-15 minutes)

### Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main/master branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify changes
git status
# Should show:
# - modified: lib/supabase/client.ts
# - modified: lib/calculations/revenue.ts
# - new file: app/error.tsx
# - new file: app/global-error.tsx
# - new file: components/ChartErrorBoundary.tsx
# - new file: supabase/migrations/00001_enable_rls.sql
# - new file: supabase/migrations/00002_add_indexes.sql

# 3. Build locally to verify
npm run build
# Should complete without errors

# 4. Test locally (optional but recommended)
npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# - Test error boundary (throw error in a page)
# - Test RLS (login as different users)
# - Verify calculations match expected values

# 5. Commit changes (if not already committed)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1 critical fixes - RLS, indexes, error boundaries, connection pooling"

# 6. Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### Deployment Platforms

#### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Automatic deployment on push (if connected to GitHub)
# Or manual deployment:
vercel --prod

# Monitor deployment:
# - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
# - Check deployment logs
# - Wait for "Ready" status
# - Visit production URL
```

#### Netlify

```bash
# Automatic deployment on push (if connected to GitHub)
# Or manual deployment:
netlify deploy --prod

# Monitor deployment:
# - Go to https://app.netlify.com
# - Check deployment logs
# - Wait for "Published" status
```

#### Other Platforms (Docker, VPS, etc.)

```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Or with PM2 for process management:
pm2 start npm --name "sd-fm-app" -- start
pm2 save
```

---

## STEP 3: POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION (10-15 minutes)

### 1. Test RLS Policies (CRITICAL)

**Create 2 test users in different organizations:**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:

-- Create test organizations
INSERT INTO organizations (id, name, slug)
VALUES
  ('org-test-a', 'Test Org A', 'test-org-a'),
  ('org-test-b', 'Test Org B', 'test-org-b');

-- Create test scenarios
INSERT INTO scenarios (organization_id, name, type)
VALUES
  ('org-test-a', 'Scenario A', 'base'),
  ('org-test-b', 'Scenario B', 'base');

-- Link test users (replace with actual user IDs from auth.users)
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role)
VALUES
  ('user-1-uuid', 'org-test-a', 'owner'),
  ('user-2-uuid', 'org-test-b', 'owner');
```

**Test in application:**
1. Login as User 1 → Should only see "Scenario A"
2. Login as User 2 → Should only see "Scenario B"
3. User 1 attempts to access User 2's scenario ID directly → Should get 404 or empty data

**Expected**: ✅ Users isolated to their organizations

### 2. Test Performance Improvements

**Before (if you have baseline metrics):**
- Dashboard load: ~1,220ms
- Scenarios list: ~200ms
- Financial statements: ~295ms

**After (expected with indexes):**
- Dashboard load: <400ms (3x faster)
- Scenarios list: <50ms (4x faster)
- Financial statements: <80ms (3.5x faster)

**How to measure:**
```javascript
// In browser console (Chrome DevTools → Console):
console.time('Dashboard Load');
// Click on dashboard link
// After page loads:
console.timeEnd('Dashboard Load');
// Should show < 400ms
```

### 3. Test Error Boundaries

**Method 1: Temporary Test Error**
```typescript
// Add to any page temporarily (e.g., app/page.tsx):
'use client';

export default function Home() {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    throw new Error('Test error boundary');
  }
  // ... rest of component
}
```

**Expected**: Red error UI with "Try again" button (NOT white screen)

**Method 2: Network Error Simulation**
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Click "Offline" to simulate network failure
3. Refresh page or trigger data fetch
4. Should see graceful error message (NOT crash)

### 4. Test Connection Pooling

**Monitor Active Connections:**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT
  count(*) as connection_count,
  state,
  application_name
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database()
GROUP BY state, application_name
ORDER BY connection_count DESC;
```

**Load test:**
1. Open 10 tabs to different pages
2. Refresh each 5 times
3. Check connection count (should stay 1-2, NOT increase to 50+)

**Expected**: ✅ Stable connection count

### 5. Test License Calculation Fix

**Test in browser console:**
```javascript
// Visit /revenue page
// Open console
// Calculate license breakdown for Year 5 (631 customers):
const totalCustomers = 631;
const singleUser = Math.round(totalCustomers * 0.899);
const team = Math.round(totalCustomers * 0.090);
const enterprise = Math.round(totalCustomers * 0.011);

console.log({ singleUser, team, enterprise });
// Expected: { singleUser: 567, team: 57, enterprise: 7 }
// Total: 567 + 57 + 7 = 631 ✓
```

**Compare with UI:**
- Navigate to Revenue page
- Check Year 5 projections
- Verify license breakdown matches: 567 / 57 / 7

---

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURE (If Issues Occur)

### Rollback Database Migrations

```sql
-- EMERGENCY: Disable RLS if causing issues
ALTER TABLE scenarios DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE personnel_roles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE monthly_opex_projections DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE annual_projections DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE funding_rounds DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE assumptions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop indexes if causing performance issues
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_scenarios_organization_id;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_scenarios_created_at;
-- (Repeat for all indexes as needed)

-- Delete user_organizations table if needed
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_organizations CASCADE;
```

### Rollback Application Code

```bash
# Find commit hash before changes
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build

# Deploy
vercel --prod
# or
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Users Can't See Any Data After RLS Deployment

**Cause**: Missing user_organizations records

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check if user has organization links:
SELECT * FROM user_organizations WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- If empty, create link:
INSERT INTO user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', 'YOUR_ORG_ID', 'owner');
```

### Issue: Queries Still Slow After Index Deployment

**Cause**: Query planner not using indexes / needs statistics update

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Update table statistics
VACUUM ANALYZE scenarios;
VACUUM ANALYZE annual_projections;
VACUUM ANALYZE monthly_opex_projections;
VACUUM ANALYZE personnel_roles;

-- Force index usage (testing only)
SET enable_seqscan = OFF;
-- Run your query
-- Should now use indexes
```

### Issue: "Connection Pool Exhausted" Errors

**Cause**: Old deployment still running / multiple instances

**Fix**:
```bash
# Kill old processes
pm2 stop all
pm2 delete all

# Restart with new code
pm2 start npm --name "sd-fm-app" -- start

# Or in Vercel/Netlify:
# - Redeploy to ensure old instances are terminated
# - Check deployment logs for multiple instances
```

### Issue: Error Boundaries Not Catching Errors

**Cause**: Error thrown outside error boundary scope

**Fix**:
- Ensure error.tsx is in correct directory (app/error.tsx, not nested)
- Verify 'use client' directive is present
- Check error is thrown during render (not in event handler)
- For async errors, use error boundaries in calling component

### Issue: License Calculations Still Wrong

**Cause**: Cache not cleared / old code running

**Fix**:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Clear browser cache
# Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files

# Verify code change:
grep -n "0.899" lib/calculations/revenue.ts
# Should show line with: totalCustomers * 0.899
```

## MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS

### After Deployment, Monitor:

**1. Error Tracking**
- Sentry, LogRocket, or similar service
- Watch for error spikes
- Check error types (RLS, performance, calculations)

**2. Performance Metrics**
- Vercel Analytics or similar
- Page load times (should be faster)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

**3. Database Metrics**
- Supabase Dashboard → Database tab
- Query performance (should improve)
- Connection count (should be stable)
- Index usage (should show scans > 0)

**4. User Feedback**
- Test with real users ASAP
- Look for:
  - "Can't see my data" → RLS issue
  - "App is faster" → Indexes working
  - "Errors look better" → Error boundaries working

---
